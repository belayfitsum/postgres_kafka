# postgres_kafka
This project demonstrates how to integrate Kafka with a PostgreSQL database, using Producer and Consumer components. The Producer sends data to a Kafka topic, while the Consumer listens for incoming messages from the Kafka topic . It also creates a table in the database and adds entry to it.
